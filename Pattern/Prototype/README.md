# Prototype Pattern

## What is the Prototype Pattern?
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. It is useful for creating new objects by cloning a prototype instance.

## Real-World Problem
Suppose you are building a document editor where users can duplicate documents. You want to create a new document with the same content as an existing one, but as a separate object.

## Solution with Prototype Pattern
The pattern lets you define a `Clone` method in your objects, so you can create copies easily.

## Example Code
```csharp
// Prototype interface
public interface IPrototype<T> {
    T Clone();
}

// Concrete prototype
public class Document : IPrototype<Document> {
    public string Content { get; set; }
    public Document(string content) { Content = content; }
    public Document Clone() => new Document(Content);
}

// Usage
var doc = new Document("Hello");
var copy = doc.Clone();
Console.WriteLine(copy.Content); // Hello
```

## How This Solves the Problem
- Allows creation of new objects by copying existing ones.
- Reduces the need for subclassing or complex constructors.
- Makes it easy to duplicate objects with the same state.

## Summary
The Prototype Pattern is ideal for cases where object creation is costly or complex, and you want to duplicate existing objects efficiently.
